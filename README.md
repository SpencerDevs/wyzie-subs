## A simple easy to use Subtitle Scraper API

### Features
- **Simple**: Just send a request to the API with the TMDB or IMDB ID of the movie or TV show and get the subtitles for.
- **Fast**: The API is hosted on a edge cloud provider with multiple proxies for spoofing requests (response time varies).
- **Free**: The API is completely free to use and has no rate limits (don't abuse this please üôè).
- **Open-Source**: The API is open-source and you can host it yourself if you want to.

### Usage Example

**Required Environment Variable**: you need to set the `PROXIES` environment variable to your CORS proxies urls.

```
PROXIES=https://torn-unicorn.fly.dev,https://proxy.wyzie.ru
```

Please note: the `id` url parameter can be used interchangable with either a TMDB ID or an IMDB ID. It checks for "tt" to determine if it's an IMDB ID or not. Using a TMDB ID is slower as we have to request the IMDB ID from TMDB first.
<sup>
  All parameters work with both TMDB and IMDB IDs, aswell as shows and movies.

<sup>
  P.S. The reason the initial commit is so large is because I had to upload the entire project to this account from the sussy-code organization. I had to do this because the main website is hosted on private repository with a huge proxies.json file instead of env vars. This repo is also out of date with the main production one.
